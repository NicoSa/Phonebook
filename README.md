## Welcome to my Phonebook app


Hi, this is a little program I´m fiddling around with to learn Sinatra, Ruby, MongoDB, HTML, CSS and even a little bit Javascript.

It´s basically a phonebook. You can create an account, create/delete/update/read entries and search through them. You can also delete your account. You can have a look at the app on heroku http://telefonbuch.heroku.com.

You will however need a Mongo Database to run tests on this.
