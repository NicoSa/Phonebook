Welcome to my Phonebook app
===

Hi, this is a little program I was fiddling around with before starting at Makers Academy to learn some basics in  Sinatra, Ruby, MongoDB, HTML, CSS and even a little bit Javascript.

ItÂ´s basically a phonebook. You can create an account, create/delete/update/read entries and search through them. You can also delete your account.

You will however need a Mongo Database to run tests on this.
